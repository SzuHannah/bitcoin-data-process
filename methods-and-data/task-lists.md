### Wallet-Wallet graph

The final wallet-wallet graph database used for analysis contained the following nodes and edges:

(1) Node

| Node Type   | Node Properties                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wallet      | <ul><li>walletID</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Transaction | <ul><li>transactionID (generated by concatenating block height and transaction index, e.g., the first transaction at block height 101 has transactionID 101_0)</li><li>timestamp (inherited from block height's timestamp) </li></ul> |

(2) Edge

| Edge Type | Edge Property     |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| Input     | transaction value |
| Output    | transaction value |

After the database was constructed, we filtered to keep transaction data after January 2017 (until June 2020). It was believed that bitcoin started to become popular among the right-wing activists after 2017.

As PPR runs faster on a more connected graph, we removed self-loops and nodes whose total degree â‰¤ 1. Eventually, the wallet-wallet graph contains 206,637,177 nodes and 503,589,462 edges.

### External data source for wallet characterization

We collected some external information from the Internet to help interpret the owners of the addresses (i.e., the wallets).&#x20;

(1) Alt-right activists' bitcoin addresses that are public online&#x20;

(2) Top rich addresses scraped from well-known cryptocurrency transaction websites&#x20;

(3) By observation&#x20;

(4) Twitter and Medium posts' discussions
