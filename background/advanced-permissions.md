# The famous and the far-right figures

To characterize clusters of addresses (i.e., wallets), we collected well-known addresses and their owner information on the Internet. Those include the right-wing figures' addresses and top-wealthy addresses scraped from famous gambling or currency exchange websites. We compiled a list of 47 right-wing figures for the right-wing party, consisting of websites and famous people, e.g., Amren.com, Dailystormer.eu, VDARE, Nick Fuentes, etc; for the gambling or currency exchange websites, there are 382 well-known websites in our database despite some closed recently. To name a few, Becoin.ag, Bitstamp.net, PocketDice.io, etc.
