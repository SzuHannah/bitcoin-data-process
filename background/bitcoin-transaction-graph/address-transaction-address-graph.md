# Address-Transaction-Address Graph

Multiple input and output addresses may be involved in one transaction. As shown in Figure. 2, t1 and t2 each represents one transaction; t1 has a1, a2 as its input addresses, and a3, a2 as output addresses; t2 has a2, a4 as input addresses, and a3, a4 as output addresses. In our transaction graph, we also include the transaction timestamp, which was inherited from the block, illustrating when the block was mined. Thus, all transactions within one specific block would have the same timestamp.
