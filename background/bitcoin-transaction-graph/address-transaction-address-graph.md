# Address-Transaction-Address Graph

Multiple input and output addresses may be involved in one transaction. As shown in [Figure 2](#Figure-2-Bitcoin-transaction-graph), $$t_{1}$$and $$t_{2}$$ each represents one transaction; $$t_{1}$$has $$a_{1}$$, $$a_{2}$$ as its input addresses, and $$a_{3}$$, $$a_{2}$$ as output addresses; $$t_{2}$$ has $$a_{2}$$, $$a_{4}$$ as input addresses, and $$a_{3}$$, $$a_{4}$$ as output addresses. In our transaction graph, we also include the transaction timestamp, which was inherited from the block, illustrating when the block was mined. Thus, all transactions within one specific block would have the same timestamp.
