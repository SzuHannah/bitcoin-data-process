# Blockchain

The primary data source of the Bitcoin network is the blockchain. As shown in [Figure 1](blockchain.md#Figure-1-Bitcoin-network-schema), in practice, the blockchain is divided into several .dat files stored in users' computers. The blockchain consists of a chain of blocks generated (mined) by solving complex math problems. The difficulty was set to a level such that the problems could be solved about every 10 minutes. An ethical miner would include thousands of transactions per block. The graph that we are interested in is the transaction graph that can uncover latent user transaction behaviors.
