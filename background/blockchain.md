# Blockchain

The main data source of the Bitcoin network is the blockchain. As shown in [Figure 1](#Figure-1-Bitcoin-network-schema), in practice, the blockchain is divided into several .dat files that were stored within every user's computer. The blockchain consists of a chain of blocks, which were generated (mined) through solving a difficult math problem. The difficulty was set to a level such that the problem could be solved about every 10 minutes. An ethical miner would include thousands of transactions per block. The graph that we are interested in is the transaction graph that can uncover latent user transaction behaviors.
